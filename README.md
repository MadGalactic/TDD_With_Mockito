# TDD_With_Mockito
Working on this repo in an effort to improve TDD skills. In tandem, the artist database app will be worked on as the goal is to create the app with a TDD approach. I'm studying various ebooks on the topics of JUnit and Mockito. The end result will be to have a firm grasp of unit testing and be able to apply TDD principles when beginning apps and refactoring code.
